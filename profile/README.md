## Hi there 👋

Tap To Web3 Fast.

The term IBuidl comes from Indie Hacker, and the use of buidl here is a slang term for the web3 industry, so IBuidl can also be an independent developer in the web3 industry, they are a group of remote workers who have their own craft and can earn by participating in the hackathon, and at the same time, they may be a contributor to the open-source public chain or project, so IBuidl is a group of creative, independent thinkers.
